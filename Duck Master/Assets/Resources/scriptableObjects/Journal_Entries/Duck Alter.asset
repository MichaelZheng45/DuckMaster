  JournalEntryText: "Ah, a Duck Altar. I\u2019ve heard a lot about these things. Apparently
    they\u2019re more commonly found on the backs of much older Island Ducks, the
    ones that are reaching 1,000 or older. They do look interesting. I\u2019m surprised
    I never encountered any of these when I was going on my journey with my first
    Island Duck. Well, I suppose I did live on a different Island Duck back then,
    I was surrounded by different Island Ducks, and the Island Ducks don\u2019t just
    stay stationary in the sky. Actually, having said all that, it really isn\u2019t
    shocking that I never saw anything like this, back then. But would you look at
    all this? I wish I knew more about these things, they sure do look amazing."

  JournalEntryText: "A Duck Altar? I\u2019m surprised I never encountered these during
    my travels with Fern. Well, I suppose it isn\u2019t shocking that I never saw
    anything like this, given how Island Ducks are always moving around one another.
    But still, I wish I knew more about these things, they sure do look amazing."

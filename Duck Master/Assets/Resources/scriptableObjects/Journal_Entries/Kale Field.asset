  JournalEntryText: "What is it this called again? I usually just refer to it as bait.
    Yeah, there\u2019s like... three(?) variations of bait, but it\u2019s all still
    bait. Sure, some bait makes the Island Ducks move away from it, and others make
    them take a direct B-Line towards it, and others make them jump, but the effects
    are all the same, in my eyes."

  JournalEntryText: "I had this house built on the back of the first Island Duck I
    ever met and trained. I named her Fern, because that\u2019s the plant I found
    her in. She\u2019s my precious baby girl. And now I\u2019m training her baby.
    Ahh... This brings back so many memories. This is gonna be a fun adventure!"

  JournalEntryText: "My log cabin. I had that house built on the back of the first
    Island Duck I ever properly met. I named her Fern, because that\u2019s the plant
    I found her in. It was also the noise she made when she tried to attack me after
    finding her. I have so many great memories with Fern, she\u2019s my precious baby
    girl. I just can\u2019t comprehend why someone would abandon a baby island duck.
    It sickens me, just to think about it! Do you know how hard it is for an infant
    to defend for itself? It\u2019s would be decently difficult for it, like on the
    harder end of medium difficulty! Babies can\u2019t even walk, do you expect them
    to do something of upper medium difficulty?! I can\u2019t even do something that
    hard!"

  JournalEntryText: "My log cabin. I had that house built on the back of the first
    Island Duck I ever properly met. I named her Fern, because that\u2019s the plant
    I found her in. I have so many great memories with Fern, she\u2019s my precious
    baby girl. And now I\u2019m training her baby. Ahhh\u2026 This brings back so
    many memories. This is gonna be a fun adventure!"

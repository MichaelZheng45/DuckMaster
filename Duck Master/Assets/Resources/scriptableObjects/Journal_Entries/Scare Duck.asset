  JournalEntryText: "A Scare Duck, huh? I remember once when my Duck Master professor
    brought in one of these things. It was inside a lead box before they showed it
    to us. The professor said while adult Island Ducks don\u2019t mind them, young
    Island Ducks are generally afraid of them, and will try to avoid them. No one
    has been able to figure out why this is."

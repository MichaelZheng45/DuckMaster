  JournalEntryText: "A Scare Duck, huh? I\u2019ve only encountered one of these once
    before. It was in my Duck Master major class, the professor brought in one of
    these things. It was inside a lead box before they showed it to us. They wanted
    to make sure all windows were closed, before they showed it to us. The professor
    said that if an Island Duck ever sees even a glimpse of one of these things, it
    goes insane, and with their strength, that\u2019s a massive problem. I should
    call the Special Forces once I\u2019m near a phone, this thing is a ticking time-bomb,
    just waiting for the duck it\u2019s on to notice it\u2019s here. How did someone
    even get this thing here, without alerting any ducks? Someone must have seen the
    surrounding Island Ducks freak out when this was put here! Well, I can\u2019t
    worry about that now. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t remove this thing myself, I
    might alert this Island Duck to its presence. I need to leave this to the Special
    Forces. WAIT! Oh no, my duck\u2026 Oh, my pet duck isn\u2019t freaking out\u2026
    Wait, that doesn\u2019t make sense, why would\u2026 OH! That\u2019s right! The
    professor had his own pet duck in the class when they opened the lead case. Apparently
    baby Island Ducks are only slightly scared of them, they\u2019ll avoid them, but
    they won\u2019t freak out. Wooh, can\u2019t believe I almost forgot that. Though,
    I guess I should be glad that is how it works, otherwise my pet duck would have
    gone crazy, altered this Island Duck, and it would have started thrashing around
    like crazy, with us on its back. That probably wouldn\u2019t have ended very well
    for us."

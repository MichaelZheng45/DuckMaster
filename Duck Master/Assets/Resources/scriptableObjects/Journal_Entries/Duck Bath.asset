  JournalEntryName: Duck Bath
  JournalEntryText: "I\u2019ve always had my pet Island Ducks take baths in my own
    bathtub. They only deserve the best, afterall. Bathtime was always fairly easy
    with Fern, save for a few times she broke my fingers by biting them. She didn\u2019t
    mean it though, she was just playing. Island ducks are just that strong. But her
    baby is even easier to deal with. To get it to stay calm in the bathtub, all I
    have to do is put my loudspeakers on full blast, and play heavy metal music. It
    calms the little baby down instantly. It even falls asleep to it, sometimes."

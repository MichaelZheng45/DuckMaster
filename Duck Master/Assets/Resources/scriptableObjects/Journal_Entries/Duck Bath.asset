  JournalEntryText: "I\u2019ve always had my pet Island Ducks take baths in my own
    bathtub, as they only deserve the best. Bathtime was always fairly easy with Fern,
    but her baby is even easier to deal with. To get it to stay calm in the bathtub,
    all I just put my loudspeakers on full, and play heavy metal music. Calms it down
    instantly, it even falls asleep to it, sometimes."

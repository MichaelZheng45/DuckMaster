  JournalEntryText: "Huh, an Island Duck Bait Dispenser. A lot of other Duck Master\u2019s
    campaigned to have these things implemented on the backs of most Island Ducks,
    so that they could better manager their baby Island Ducks. I, obviously, am a
    cut above most Duck Masters. My pet duck listens to me, even without cheating
    methods like bait. I mean, yeah, I do SOMETIMES use bait, but it\u2019s only in
    instances where my commands aren\u2019t enough to make my pet duck do exactly
    what I need it to do. Me and my pet duck are friends, our relationship isn\u2019t
    built solely on me providing a constant flow of treats."

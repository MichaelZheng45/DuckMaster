  JournalEntryText: "Huh, an Island Duck Bait Dispenser. A lot of other Duck Master\u2019s
    campaigned to have these things implemented on the backs of most Island Ducks,
    so that they could better manage their baby Island Ducks. I, obviously, am a cut
    above most Duck Masters. My pet duck and I are friends, our relationship isn\u2019t
    built solely on me providing a constant flow of treats."

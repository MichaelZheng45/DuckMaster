  JournalEntryText: "Holy duckling in heaven! It\u2019s ancient duck art! I\u2019ve
    never seen anything like it! I mean, yeah, Island Ducks can live for up to, like,
    a thousand and a half years, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever find one that
    old\u2026 WOW. It\u2019s almost completely worn away, but I can still tell how
    much time and effort went into every detail! It\u2019s beautiful! This\u2026 This
    is a duck masterpiece!"

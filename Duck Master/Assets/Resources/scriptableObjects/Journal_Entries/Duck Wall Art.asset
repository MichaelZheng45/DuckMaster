  JournalEntryText: "Holy duckling in heaven! Look at this! It\u2019s ancient duck
    art! What is this place? I\u2019ve never seen anything like it! But this place
    is clearly old, just look at the state these art walls are in. Wait, how old is
    this Island Duck? Island Ducks can live for up to, like, a thousand and a half
    years. So who knows how old this stuff is\u2026 Island Ducks always move around
    freely, so it's very difficult to ever find your way over to other ducks. Only
    just recently did people find ways to easily do so, those being the ways I\u2019ve
    been using to get from Island to Island. It could have been centuries since anyone
    has stood on top of this Island Duck\u2026 That\u2019s kind of sad. All that time
    being alone? Well, this Island Duck probably hung out with other Island Ducks,
    but still\u2026 WOW. I just took a closer look at the art on these walls! Would
    you look at this! It\u2019s almost completely worn away, but I can still tell
    how much time and effort went into every detail! It\u2026 It\u2019s beautiful!
    This\u2026 This is a duck masterpiece! O.K., yeah, I DEFINITELY need to tell people
    about this when I finish this trip."

  JournalEntryName: Deadliest Catch
  JournalEntryText: "Deadliest Catch is a documentary television series produced by
    Original Productions for the Discovery Channel.It portrays the real life events
    aboard fishing vessels in the Bering Sea during the Alaskan king crab, opilio
    crab and bairdi crab fishing seasons. The Aleutian Islands port of Dutch Harbor,
    Alaska, is the base of operations for the fishing fleet.The show's title derives
    from the inherent high risk of injury or death associated with the work. Deadliest
    Catch premiered on the Discovery Channel on April 12, 2005, and currently airs
    worldwide. The first season consisted of ten episodes, with the finale airing
    on June 14, 2005. Subsequent seasons have aired on the same April to June or July
    schedule every year since the original 2005 season.The 14th season premiered on
    April 10, 2018.[1] On March 7, 2019, Discovery Channel announced the series will
    return for a fifteenth season to premiere on Tuesday, April 9, 2019.   The series
    follows life on \"the vast Bering Sea\" aboard various crab fishing boats during
    two of the crab fishing seasons, the October king crab season and the January
    opilio crab (C. opilio; often referred to as \"snow crab\" or \"opies\") season.
    The show emphasizes the dangers on deck to the fishermen (and the Discovery Channel
    camera crews recording their work) as crews duck heavy crab pots swinging into
    position, maneuver hundreds of pounds of crab across a deck strewn with hazards
    (i. e., holding tank hatches, uneven surfaces, maintenance access plates, wet
    decks), and lean over the rails to position pots for launch or retrieval as galeforce
    winds and high waves constantly lash the deck. The series also documents the dangers
    of being on a boat in the Bering Sea, in the midst of some of the coldest and
    stormiest waters on earth, where even a minor problem may become complex or even
    catastrophic with the nearest port often hundreds of miles away. Each episode
    focuses on a story, situation or theme that occurs on one or more boats, while
    side stories delve into the backgrounds and activities of one or two crew members,
    particularly the \"greenhorns\" (rookie crew members) on several boats. The fleet's
    captains are featured prominently, highlighting their camaraderie with their fellow
    captains and relationships with their crews, as well as their competition with
    other boats in the hunt for crab. Common themes include friendly rivalries among
    the captains (particularly between Sig Hansen of the Northwestern, and Johnathan
    and Andy Hillstrand of the Time Bandit), the familial ties throughout the fleet
    (brothers Sig, Norm, and Edgar Hansen, who own the Northwestern; the Hillstrand
    brothers and Johnathan's son Scott on the Time Bandit; brothers Keith and Monte
    Colburn of the Wizard), the stresses of life on the Bering Sea, and the high burnout
    rate among greenhorns. Because Alaskan crab fishing is one of the most dangerous
    jobs in the world, the U.S. Coast Guard rescue squads stationed at Integrated
    Support Command Kodiak (Kodiak, Alaska) and their outpost on St. Paul Island,
    near the northern end of the crab fishing grounds, are frequently shown rescuing
    crab boat crew members who fall victim to the harsh conditions on the Bering Sea.
    The USCG rescue squad was featured prominently during the episodes surrounding
    the loss of F/V Big Valley in January 2005, the loss of F/V Ocean Challenger in
    October 2006, and the loss of F/V Katmai in October 2008. Original Productions
    keeps a camera crew stationed with the Coast Guard during the filming of the show.
    \  The show has no on-camera host. A narrator provides commentary connecting the
    storylines as the show shifts from one boat to another. Discovery Channel voice
    artist Mike Rowe narrates the action for North American airings; UK voice artist
    Bill Petrie, reading from a slightly altered script, offers a regionally familiar
    accent for a British audience, and Nasir Bilal Khan provides the voice for the
    episodes aired in Malaysia. The show transitions between boats using a mock-up
    radar screen that shows the positions of the boats relative to one another and
    to the two ends of the fishing grounds, St. Paul Island to the north and Dutch
    Harbor to the south. Rowe was originally supposed to be the on-camera host as
    well and he appeared in taped footage as himself during the first season of shooting.
    As filming of the first season was nearing completion, Discovery greenlighted
    production on another Rowe project, Dirty Jobs, under the condition that Rowe
    choose only one show on which to appear on camera. As Rowe relates the story,
    Discovery told him that the two shows would be airing back-to-back on the same
    night, thus, \"We can't have you telling us stories about six dead fishermen on
    camera and making a fart joke with your arm in a cow's ass.\"[3] Most of the footage
    Rowe shot during the first season became part of the first season's \"Behind the
    Scenes\" episode. After the third season of Deadliest Catch, Rowe began hosting
    a post-season behind-the-scenes miniseries entitled After the Catch, a roundtable
    discussion featuring the captains relating their experiences filming the preceding
    season's episodes. A season 3 episode of Dirty Jobs (2007-2008) saw Rowe return
    to Alaska to take part in a job tangentially related to the fishing industry \u2014
    diesel fuel spill cleanup. Another episode that same season featured Rowe at work
    on board the F/V Legacy doing trawl fishing and at-sea shellfish and other seafood
    processing, during which Rowe made numerous references to the crab fishing of
    Deadliest Catch.    Because Deadliest Catch is essentially a filmed record of
    everyday life in a stressful working environment, the producers have to censor
    gestures and language deemed inappropriate for television audiences. For example,
    under the U.S. Television Ratings system, Deadliest Catch is rated TV-14 with
    inappropriate language (\"L\") as a highlighted concern.[4] For visual disguise
    of such items as finger gestures, bloody injuries, or non-featured crew member
    anonymity, the producers use the traditional pixelization or simple blurring.
    However, due to the sheer volume of profanities used in the course of everyday
    crew member conversation, the producers occasionally employ alternate methods
    of censoring profanities, using sound effects such as a ship's horn, the \"clang\"
    of a hatch door, or a burst of radio static in place of the traditional \"bleep\"."

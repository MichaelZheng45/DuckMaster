  JournalEntryText: "Ah. Duck Totems. I love these things. Well, I mean, I haven\u2019t
    actually seen one until this very moment, but I\u2019ve always loved the concept
    of them. Speaking of which, from what I remember, these totems are made by other
    duck masters. They leave them on the backs of Island Ducks who saved their life.
    So, I guess the Island Duck I\u2019m standing on, saved someone at some point."

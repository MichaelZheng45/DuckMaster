  JournalEntryText: "Ah. Duck Totems. I love these things. I\u2019ve never really
    seen one in real life, but I have heard of them. So\u2026 You know, when I say
    I \u201Clove them\u201D, I mean I love the concept of them. Well, not that I don\u2019t
    also like the look of them, I just haven\u2019t seen any until this very moment.
    Speaking of which, from what I remember, these totems are made by other duck masters.
    They leave them on the backs of ducks who saved their life. So I guess the duck
    I\u2019m standing on, saved someone at some point. That\u2019s cool. And the totem
    also looks absolutely beautiful, I mean, this duck obviously made the correct
    choice in saving whoever made this."

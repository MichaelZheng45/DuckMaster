  JournalEntryText: "Hm. That is one huge Duck Statue. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably
    a 1/20th scale model of whatever Island Duck it was based on. If we actually made
    a to-scale model of any fully grown Island Duck, it would be way too heavy. And
    personally, I can\u2019t really blame them for not wanting to do that. We already
    have them carrying so much."

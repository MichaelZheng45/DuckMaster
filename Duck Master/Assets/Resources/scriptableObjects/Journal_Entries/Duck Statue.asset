  JournalEntryText: "Hm. That is one huge Duck Statue. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably
    a 1/20th scale model of whatever Island Duck it was based on. If we actually made
    a to-scale model of any fully grown Island Duck, we would probably have to make
    it out of super light materials, and make it completely hollow, otherwise, well,
    there is not a single Island Duck in existence that would willingly carry something
    that unfathomably heavy. And I can\u2019t really blame them. We\u2019re pushing
    the limit by having them carry skyscrapers on their backs, but at least those
    are somewhat hollow. A to-scale, non-hollow Island Duck Statue would make those
    skyscrapers feel like a feather in comparison.And Island Ducks naturally carry
    hundreds feathers! So it would be like nothing to them! That\u2019s the analogy
    I\u2019m trying to make."

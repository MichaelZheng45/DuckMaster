  JournalEntryText: "Hm. A stick. This reminds me\u2026 There was one time when my
    pet duck kicked down the door to the kitchen, it completely ripped the hinges
    off the frame. It did that because I was singing while doing the dishes, and I
    hadn\u2019t heard it's quacking and knocking to get  me to shut up... Wait, why
    am I holding a stick?"
